# Writing a JS Front-End for your API

## Introduction

We're going to write a search page that reaches into our API without refreshing the page. This should all be written through jQuery and AJAX â€“ do not modify the controllers!

## Instructions

To run the JS tests, run `rake jasmine`. Visit `localhost:8888`. Learn will not keep track of your JS tests, but you'll want to make those pass first.

Once your JS tests pass, run `learn --fail-fast` and make the RSpec tests pass!
